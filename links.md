## Week 02

1. [(Video) C Programming Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0)<br>
This YouTube video tutorial helps me learn C programming language from zero. The instructor explain it really well, so I think finishing this video tutorial can make you familiar enough with C programming language.

## Week 03

1. [(Article) How to Format Disk Partitions in Linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-format-disk)<br>
This article helps me understand about the difference between Disk Formats and which OS supports them. It also explains about partition checking, formatting disks on linux, and mounting disks on Linux.

2. [(Article) Develop your own filesystem with FUSE](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/l-fuse/)<br>

4. [(Article) Differences between /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin](https://askubuntu.com/questions/308045/differences-between-bin-sbin-usr-bin-usr-sbin-usr-local-bin-usr-local)<br>
Within this OS course, we see a lot of this things like "/bin/" or "/sbin/" and many more things similar to it. And honestly, I don't really know what it is. With this article came from community, I now know the difference between them.

## Week 04
1. [(Article) Understanding Big and Little Endian Byte Order](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/)<br>
This article explains really well about the difference between big and little endian. It also tells you the reason why microprocessors use little endian while networking protocol uses big endian.

2. [(Video) How to manage memory with malloc, calloc, realloc, and free in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQP4X3odvHE)<br>
This video explains about memory management using malloc, calloc, realloc, and free method. It also explains with a sample code, so we can try to run the sample code by ourself

Well, honestly when I see the Week04 demos code, I got scared by pointers. Because it is easy to confused if we don't look at the code thoroughly. Moreover, it rarely used by programmers. But actually, it is just an address. This article break down every details of pointers.

## Week 05
1. [(Article) Paging](https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging)<br>
This article tells you about paging structure in operating system development. The article covers a lot of topics regarding Memory Paging.
2. [(Article) Operating System - Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A complete explanation about virtual memory. I can say it is the summary of Chapter 10. I prefer to read from this article to understand about virtual memory rather than the Chapter 10 ppt  because I think it explains better.
3. [(Article) Compare top and htop](https://codeahoy.com/compare/top-vs-htop)<br>
Besides top, there are a lot of other tools that also has a cool functionality, which is htop. It is a good article for additional reference of our material this week.

Along the way learning about OS, and especially in this week, I am thinking should I upgrade our RAM or not to upgrade the performance. Or using virtual memory is enough? And this article explains to me that we really need to have a computer that has many RAM in the future. (Hope I have enough money to purchase it :D)

## Week 06
1. [(Video) Linux processes, init, fork/exec, ps, kill, fg, bg, jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJzltwv7jJs)<br>

If you want to understand more about linux processes and have every detail of it be explained, then this YouTube playlist is right for you. It explains to you in a slow-paces, so if you a type of person who want to get everything quickly, I recommend you to play the video on 2.0x playback. (ssst! I even play it on 3.0x playback :D)
3. [(Article) Difference between Process and Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)<br>
It quites confusing to differentiate these two term. Thanks to this article, I have a clear understanding about those term. We can say, a process consist of threads. And that means thread is inside the process.

With this article, now I have a better understanding regarding another two terms that is pretty similar like in my links number 3. Multithreading is still inside a process and can run simultaneously, while multiprocessing has a bigger scope than multithreading.
