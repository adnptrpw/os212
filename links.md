## Week 00

1. [(Book) Operating System Concepts](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/index.html)<br>
I found reading this book is really worth it. It is already separated by the topics using slides presentation, so it becomes chunk size and easy to understand.
I recommend reading this book for preparing our weekly quiz because the information is so complete.

2. [(Video) Operating Systems: Visual Metaphor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqoiDr4YpRdm_nzFhCDuj74P8ul5z7SdO)<br>
This video playlist explains to you really well how the operating system works. 
It gives you a good example in real life to relate more and then understand the operating system better.

3. [(Blogs) Introducing to GNU Linux](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/Welcome2GNULinux.html)<br>
This is a must-read blog. You will learn how to work with GNU Linux from zero to hero. I found this blog really helped me understand GNU Linux better.
